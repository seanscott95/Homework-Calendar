Work Day Scheduler

This simple calendar application allows a user to save events for each hour of the day to a daily planner. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It was created to manage time effectively and to better understand using third-party API's.

[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) was the library used to work with date and time.

When you open the planner you are presented with the current day and time displayed at the top. Below you are presented with timeblocks for the standard buisness hours of 9-5pm. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When you click on the textarea you can enter text and save it to the textarea by pressing the save button to the right of the textarea. This even saves when you refresh or leave the browser.
